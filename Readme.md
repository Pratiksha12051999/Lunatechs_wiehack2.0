Dataset selection: 
Crime in Chicago,Boston and Vancouver

RStudio:
Using R libraries, we plotted the seed points and found the Optimal number of clusters for k means clustering algorithm using Elbow Method.
We then plotted the density/rate of each crime category for each district, which showed us the types of crimes more prevalent in the state and also in a particular district.

Facebook Prophet:
The parameter which is the most effective in the prediction of crime rate was determined for Facebook Prophet using data frames and their transformations in Jupyter Notebooks. 

Frontend:
The results obtained from the plotting analysis and prediction can be integrated with front end technologies using flask framework.
